Solve duolingo lessons to proceed in leagues, it's a toy project to let you win in the Diamond league which is already humanly impossible, use responsibly

Usage:

```bash
USERNAME='[your username]' PASSWORD='[YOUR PASSWORD]' node index.js '[lesson name]' [headless]
```

If you want to see the chrome UI just don't pass the `headless` argument.

Example:

```bash
USERNAME='[your username]' PASSWORD='[YOUR PASSWORD]' node index.js 'Basics 1' headless
```
